Perform the tasks listed below. The standard format applies with the tasks listed as major headings.

--- Task 1
Read/scan Hall and Lieberman, pp. 214-218; pp.245-249; pp. 274-276; pp. 854-857. Answer the following questions in English:

	2. There are many types of stocks. List and define four(4) different types of stocks (see Task 4 below).
	3. What is the difference between bonds and stocks?
	4. Explain the differences in types of competition in markets. That is, what are the differences between markets with perfect 
	competition, market monopolies,  and markets with imperfect competition (monopolistic competition markets and market oligopolies)
	5. Why do many individuals choose to hold their wealth in stocks?
	6. The authors state, "By early 2000, the average U.S. household held more wealth in the stock market than in real estate, 
	including the value of their own home." Do you consider stock investments a wise choice? Explain.
	7. Explain the data in Table 1 on p. 857. 

--- Task 2
Read "EXCERPT_WorldBank_StockMarket-vs-Economic-Development.txt" and translate the entire excerpt into Spanish.


--- Task 3
Read i) "EXCERPT_China_StockMarket-vs-Economic-Development.txt", and ii) "EXCERPT_Mexco_StockMarket-vs-Economic-Development.txt".
Based on the three excerpts you have read, answer the following questions in English:

	1. Why does the stock market matter? 
	2. What is the role of the stock market in the economy? 
	3. Why do economists consider stock markets to be perfect competition markets? Are they?
	4. Do you think evidence and data support the claim that there is a strong empirical association between stock market development 
	and long-term economic growth?
	5. Evaluate the claim that greater stock market development encourages more diffuse corporate ownership and this diffusion of 
	ownership impedes effective corporate governance.

Market Classifications 
[rating scale 0 - 100]
######################
	Perfect Competition	<== 0
		* There are large numbers of buyers and sellers, and each buys or sells only 
		  a tiny fraction of the total quantity in the market
		* Sellers offer a standardized product
		* Sellers can easily enter into or exit from the market; minimal or no barriers
		* Short-run profits


	Monopoly <== 100 
		* A monopoly firm is the only seller of a good or service with no (close) substitutes.
		* The market in which the monopoly firm operates is called a monopoly market.
		* Key concept: substitutability
		* Substitute is truly a substitute? Substitute in the market?
		* !Ojo! Different tastes and characteristics ==> different opinions about what is, and what is not, 
		 a “close” substitute ==> people say " ... will accept no substitutes!"
		* Long-run profits 
		 
		* A natural monopoly exists when, 
			==> due to economies of scale, one firm can produce at a lower cost per unit than can other firms 
			(w/o intervention)
			
		* Small local monopolies exist when 
			==> goods/services available only at one place "... the only store in town" 
		
		* Large non-local monopolies exist when
			==> there is control of supply ==> Al bauxite for aluminum cans
			==> Govt sponsored (postal service)
		
	
		
	Imperfect Competition / Partial Monopoly <== 0 < x < 100
	(Monopolistic Competition and Oligopoly)
		* market structures somewhere between perfect competition and monopoly
		* may be more than one seller, but too few to create a truly competitive market 
		* may be differentiated products (cars, restaurants, etc); but not standardized products (Prozac)
		* may be free entry and exit or barriers
		* may be strategic interdependence; not independence
		
	
NB
Market classification (as above) is a function of the number of buyers/sellers at temporal scale and spatial scale
(movies in your neighborhood; movies in CDMX; movies in the world))
(movies in 1960; movies in 1990; movies in 2025)

NB
	==> In perfect competition, economic profit is (theoretically) "relentlessly" reduced to zero by the entry of other 
	firms == short-term profits
	==> in monopoly, economic profit can continue indefinitely == long-run profits

Stock Market
Stock Exchange
###########

Stock Markets vs.
Economic Growth
##################
According to IG, a world-leading online trading provider that gives you access to opportunities across thousands of financial markets,

	* "Stock exchanges can serve as a measure for the health of the national economy, and can also be a key indicator 
	of world economic strength. This is because the growth of the financial market equates to higher standards of 
	living and employment rates."

NB. Securities are stocks and options.

NB. Long positions and short positions refer to the securities an investor owns or securities an investor needs to own. 

Long Position 
	If an investor has a long position, it means that the investor has bought and owns securities, such as shares of 
	stocks. For instance, an investor who owns 100 shares of Tesla stock in their portfolio is said to be long 100 
	shares. This investor has paid for the shares in full. They will make money if the shares rise in value and they 
	sell them for more than they paid.
	
	For options, an investor has a long position when they buy or hold a call or put option. That is, they own the 
	right to buy or sell the security at a specified price


Short Position
	If the investor has a short position, it means that the investor sold shares of a stock [that they don't own!!] 
	(and thus, owes them to some other investor who buys them), but does not actually own them yet. For instance, an 
	investor who has sold 100 shares of Tesla without owning them is said to be short 100 shares. When the trade 
	settles, the investor with the short position must fulfill their transaction obligation by purchasing the shares in 
	the market so that they may deliver them. 

	An investor has a short position when they sell (or write) a call or put option. They are obligated to sell or buy 
	the shares.
