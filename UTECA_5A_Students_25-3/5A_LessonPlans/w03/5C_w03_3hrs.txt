Banks
* financial intermediaries 
	A business firm that specializes in brokering between savers and borrowers.

* specialize in assembling loanable funds from households and firms whose revenues exceed their expenditures, and channeling those funds to households and firms (and sometimes the government)



US banks
	depository institutions (accept deposits from the general public and lend the deposits to 		borrowers)
	
Types of US banks
* 	Savings and loan associations (S&Ls) obtain funds through their customers’ time, savings, 		and checkable deposits and use them primarily to make mortgage loans.

* 	Mutual savings banks accept deposits (called shares) and use them primarily tomake mortgage 	loans. They differ from S&Ls because they are owned by their depositors, rather than outside 	investors.

* 	Credit unions specialize in working with particular groups of people, such as members of a 		labor union or employees in a specific field of business. They acquire funds through their 		members’ deposits and make consumer and mortgage loans to other members.

* 	Commercial banks are the largest group of depository institutions. They obtain
	funds mainly by issuing checkable deposits, savings deposits, and time deposits
	and use the funds to make business, mortgage, and consumer loans.

    Commercial banks: Accept deposits from savers and lend to borrowers (depository)
