rent seeking behavior
activities where individuals or entities use their resources to gain wealth or advantages without creating new wealth or value for society, often through political or regulatory means

rigidities
situations where prices and wages are slow to adjust to changes in economic conditions, either due to nominal or real factors, impacting macroeconomic stability and market equilibrium
