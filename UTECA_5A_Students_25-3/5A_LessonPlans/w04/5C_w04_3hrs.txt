“Neoclassical economics is precisely the theory one would expect a vastly complex system of international corporations, world markets, and interconnected currencies to create [in order] to sustain, justify, explain, and predict "itself." And classical economics, correspondingly, was a predictable expression of an earlier European capitalism.”
		-- Roger M. Keesing, in "Cultural Anthropology: A Contemporary Perspective"
