General Terms

	ML		Machine Lerning
	LLM		Large Language Model
	NMT		Neural Machine Translation
	GPT		Generative Pre-Trained Transformer
	MIME	Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension; type of file format for translating
	
	API		Application Programmer Interface
	SDK		Software Development Kit
	IDE		Integrated Development Environment	
	Python	Object-oriented programming language
	
ML
A subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that gives computers the ability to learn without explicitly being programmed; the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalize to unseen data, and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions.


LLM
An artificial intelligence (AI) system that can understand, process, and generate human language. LLMs are trained on large amounts of data, such as books and articles, using machine learning techniques.


NMT
A method of automated translation that uses artificial neural networks to translate text from one language to another, essentially mimicking the human translation process by learning patterns from large datasets to predict the most likely sequence of words in the target language; a data-driven approach to machine translation considering the entire sentence context rather than just individual words.


GPT
A type of artificial intelligence (AI) model that can create human-like text. GPT is a family of neural network models that use a transformer architecture. 


MIME
Many file types can be translated by Google Translate API (NMT model). Translation will keep the original format.

Extension			MIME code Google API
---------			---------------------
.doc				application/msword
.docx				application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document
.pdf				application/pdf
.ppt				application/vnd.ms-powerpoint
.pptx				application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation
.xls				application/vnd.ms-excel
.xlsx				application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet


API
A set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other, enabling them to exchange data and functionality by defining a standardized way to request and receive information.


SDK
A collection of tools, libraries, and documentation provided to developers that allows them to create applications for a specific platform, operating system, or programming language, essentially offering everything needed to build and run software within that environment; [eg, Google Cloud CLI, Google Cloud SDK]

IDE
A software application that helps developers write, build, test, and package software. [eg, Spyder[


Python
a high-level, interpreted, object-oriented programming language known for its simple, readable syntax that closely resembles natural language, making it a popular choice for beginners and a versatile tool for various applications including web development, data analysis, automation, and machine learning

    Google Cloud Translation API	<== We will start here



==========	Google Cloud Translation API	==============================
Go thru--
https://cloud.google.com/translate/?hl=en
https://cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/translate/latest
https://cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/translate/latest/client
https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cloud-translation-python3#0		<== tutorial



---- Google-Specific Terms	---------------------------------------------------
	ADC									Application Default Credentials
	
	Google Cloud SDK					Libraries and tools for interacting with Google Cloud products and services.
	
	Cloud Client Libraries				Computer programming language-based libraries (SDKs) for use with Google APIs
	[Google API Client Libraries		Previous versions of the Cloud Client Libraries]
	Python Cloud Client Libraries		Python-code specific libraries for APIs
	

ADC (Google)
A strategy used by the authentication libraries to automatically find credentials based on the application environment. The authentication libraries make those credentials available to Cloud Client Libraries and Google API Client Libraries. When you use ADC, your code can run in either a development or production environment without changing how your application authenticates to Google Cloud services and APIs. 


Google Cloud SDK
A collection of tools that are used to interact with Cloud Client Libraries and services and manage the resources in your Google Cloud projects. Contains 
	Google Cloud CLI		-- command-line tools that provide Cloud Shellfunctionality
	Cloud Client Library	-- low-level details for enabling Cloud Client Libraries efficiently


Cloud Client Libraries
The recommended way to access Google Cloud APIs programmatically. The libraries provide high-level API abstractions so they're easier to understand. They embrace idioms of the programming language (Python, Java, PHP, C++, C#, Ruby. Go)

Sample Python Cloud Client Libraries
			AI Platform 						google-cloud-aiplatform
			AI Platform Data Labeling Service 	google-cloud-datalabeling
			API Gateway 						google-cloud-api-gateway
			API Keys API 						google-cloud-api-keys
			Access Approval 					google-cloud-access-approval
			Analytics Data API 					google-analytics-data
			...									...
			**Cloud Translation 				google-cloud-translate 	<== we'll use this one!!


Cloud Translation API 
	As is 	==> use a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model; general; the standard Google pre-trained model
	Options ==> Adaptive Translation [w/ slightly customized LLMs]
			==> AutoML Translation [w/ highly customized LLMs]

Adaptive Translation
	Creates custom translation models; trains a LLM on small amounts of specialized data; higher degree of accuracy than 
	the standard Google pre-trained model

AutoML Translation 
	Creates custom translation models; trains a LLM on large amounts of specialized data; the most accurate translations possible for highly specialized or technical content; much higher degree of accuracy than the standard Google pre-trained model;  


NB
* If you don't want to access an API programmatically (ie, using scripts from home compu), you can access some of the same  functionality using the tools in the Google Cloud console	<== we'll do this first

* Google Cloud Translation API NMT translates 194 language pairs (see below)


-----	Creating a Google Cloud Account	-------------------------------
https://console.cloud.google.com/
