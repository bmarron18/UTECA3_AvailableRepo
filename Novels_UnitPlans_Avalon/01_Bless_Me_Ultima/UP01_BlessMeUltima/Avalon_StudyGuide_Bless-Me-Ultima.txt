	9th grade English ESL; "Bless Me. Ultima" Ruldolfo Anaya, Major Themes

1. Coming of Age
The novel is a coming-of-age story that follows Antonio Márez as he navigates his journey from childhood to adolescence. Throughout the book, Antonio faces various challenges that force him to grow and mature.
    Examples: Antonio's experiences, such as witnessing death, questioning his faith, and learning from Ultima, all contribute to his development and understanding of the world.

2. Identity and Cultural Heritage
Antonio is caught between different cultural and familial expectations. His father's vaquero heritage and his mother's devout Catholic and Luna farming background represent two distinct paths for Antonio's future.
    Examples: Antonio struggles to reconcile these conflicting identities and to forge his own path. Ultima's teachings and guidance help him navigate his cultural heritage and understand his own identity.

3. Good vs. Evil
The novel explores the nature of good and evil, often through the lens of Ultima's healing practices and the presence of malevolent forces in the community.
    Examples: Ultima's confrontations with Tenorio and the black magic he uses highlight the ongoing battle between good and evil. Antonio learns to discern the complexities of morality and justice.

4. Faith and Doubt
Antonio's journey involves questioning his religious beliefs and grappling with doubts about the Catholic faith he has been raised in.
    Examples: Antonio's conversations with Ultima, his dreams, and his observations of the contradictions within the church all contribute to his struggle with faith and doubt.

5. Nature and the Supernatural
The novel frequently juxtaposes the natural world with the supernatural, emphasizing the interconnectedness of life and the spiritual realm.
    Examples: Ultima's use of herbs and her understanding of the natural world blend seamlessly with her spiritual practices, teaching Antonio about the harmony between nature and the supernatural.

6. Family and Community
Family and community play crucial roles in shaping Antonio's identity and values. The support and expectations of his family members and the broader community influence his decisions and growth.
    Examples: The Márez and Luna families represent different aspects of Antonio's heritage, and the community's reactions to Ultima's practices and the events surrounding Tenorio impact Antonio's worldview.

Theme-Based Discussion Questions

-- Chap 12
The summer passes with sadness. Gabriel is sad because his sons have left and drinks too much. Yet he realizes that it is the very same Marez blood that has called his sons away. Tony becomes interested in Ultima's collection of objects but Ultima warns him that they are not playthings. She also warns him about Tenorio and gives him her sacred pouch for protection. 

Narsico bursts in one night to warn the family that Tenorio has whipped up a lynching mob. Just then the mob arrives and accuses Ultima of witchcraft: Tenorio's daughter has died. Gabriel confronts the mob and the men shirk from cowardice. Gabriel tosses Tenorio around like a rag doll but Tenorio urges the mob on until Narsico appears armed with a rifle.. He calls the mob fools for not using the true test for witchcraft. All agree to abide by the test. Holy needles are placed on the door and Ultima must walk through the threshold to pass the test. Meanwhile Ultima's owl attacks Tenorio and blinds him. Ultima passes the test and is cleared of the charge of witchcraft. The mob leaves but the men are confused by Ultima's power as a curandera. Tony is even more confused when he finds that the holy needles have fallen from the door.

--- Chap 11
Cico appears to trust Tony enough to take him to the Golden Carp. On the way they stop in at Lupito's garden, which surprises Tony because it is so beautiful and lush. Antonio can't reconcile Lupito's living space and Lupito as the town drunk. Before getting to the special place of the Golden Carp, Tony and Cisco run into the gang. They hassle Tony and he pulls a neat magic trick: vomiting. Cisco leads Tony to the pool of the Golden Carp and Tony is absolutely amazed. He has a revolation but also there is much confusion in his mind about God, the Church, and other gods, including the monsterous black bass. Cisco and Tony develop a special bond.

Cico tells Tony about the prophecy of the Golden Carp. Tony is shocked. Tony tries to understand what this prophecy could mean and has a powerful dream. The 'waters of his blood' come to life and there is a battle. Ultima helps reconcile the forces and tells Tony that only he can decide what to believe.

--- Chapter 8
Antonio's brothers, León, Andrew, and Eugene, return from World War II, but their arrival is bittersweet. The war has changed them, and they are no longer the same people they were before they left. The brothers struggle to reintegrate into family life and the rural lifestyle of Guadalupe. Their restlessness and desire for independence become clear as they express a longing to leave home and explore new opportunities. This tension causes conflict with their parents, especially their father, Gabriel, who had high hopes for his sons to continue the family tradition of living as vaqueros (cowboys).

Antonio observes this growing divide and begins to understand the complexities of adulthood and family dynamics. He also reflects on his own future and feels caught between the different expectations of his parents: his father’s dream of freedom on the llano (plains) and his mother’s desire for him to become a priest.

--- Chapter 3 "Tres"
In Chapter Three, Antonio continues to grapple with the conflicting expectations placed upon him by his family and the cultural tensions between his parents’ differing backgrounds. His father, Gabriel, is a vaquero (cowboy) who yearns for the open plains, while his mother, María, is deeply religious and wishes for Antonio to become a priest. Antonio is also dealing with the presence of Ultima, the curandera (healer) who lives with them. He is both fascinated and mystified by her power and wisdom.

As Antonio spends more time with Ultima, he begins to observe her rituals and the way she interacts with nature. This chapter introduces the idea that Antonio is on a path of self-discovery, where he must navigate the expectations of his family, his culture, and his own identity. The chapter ends with Antonio feeling a growing sense of connection to Ultima, who seems to understand him in ways that others do not. This chapter is crucial as it sets the stage for Antonio’s internal conflict and foreshadows the spiritual and moral dilemmas he will face throughout the novel.
