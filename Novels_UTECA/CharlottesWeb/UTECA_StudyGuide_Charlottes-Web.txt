--- Chapter 4: "Loneliness"
In Chapter 4, Wilbur experiences deep loneliness. Fern, who had been his constant companion, now visits less frequently as she starts attending school. Without Fern's attention, Wilbur feels isolated in the barn. He tries to make friends with the other animals, but they are either uninterested or dismissive. Feeling rejected, Wilbur is left to grapple with his loneliness. However, the chapter ends on a hopeful note when he hears a mysterious voice in the darkness promising to be his friend, leaving Wilbur with a sense of anticipation.

--- Chapter 1: "Before Breakfast"
In the first chapter of "Charlotte's Web," we are introduced to Fern Arable, an eight-year-old girl who lives on a farm. The chapter begins early in the morning with Fern discovering that her father, Mr. Arable, is planning to kill a runt pig from a litter that was just born. Fern is horrified and convinces her father to let her keep the pig, arguing that it is unfair to kill a pig just because it is small. Mr. Arable agrees, and Fern names the pig Wilbur. She takes care of Wilbur, feeding him from a bottle and treating him like a pet.
