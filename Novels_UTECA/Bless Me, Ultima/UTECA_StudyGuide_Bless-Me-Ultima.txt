The summer passes with sadness. Gabriel is sad because his sons have left and drinks too much. Yet he realizes that it is the very same Marez blood that has called his sons away. Tony becomes interested in Ultima's collection of objects but Ultima warns him that they are not playthings. She also warns him about Tenorio and gives him her sacred pouch for protection. 

Narsico bursts in one night to warn the family that Tenorio has whipped up a lynching mob. Just then the mob arrives and accuses Ultima of witchcraft: Tenorio's daughter has died. Gabriel confronts the mob and the men shirk from cowardice. Gabriel tosses Tenorio around like a rag doll but Tenorio urges the mob on until Narsico appears armed with a rifle.. He calls the mob fools for not using the true test for witchcraft. All agree to abide by the test. Holy needles are placed on the door and Ultima must walk through the threshold to pass the test. Meanwhile Ultima's owl attacks Tenorio and blinds him. Ultima passes the test and is cleared of the charge of witchcraft. The mob leaves but the men are confused by Ultima's power as a curandera. Tony is even more confused when he finds that the holy needles have fallen from the door.

---- Chapter 10
Antonio continues to grapple with questions about his faith and the nature of good and evil. The key event in this chapter is when Antonio witnesses Ultima’s power to heal Lucas, his uncle, who is cursed by witches. Antonio watches as Ultima prepares her cure, performing a spiritual ceremony using herbs and prayers. This healing ceremony involves not only physical actions but also spiritual intervention, making Antonio question the boundary between magic and religion.The experience of seeing his uncle cured strengthens Antonio’s bond with Ultima but also deepens his questions about his religious upbringing. He begins to see that there are forces at play in the world that go beyond the conventional teachings of the church.

--- Chapter 8
Antonio's brothers, León, Andrew, and Eugene, return from World War II, but their arrival is bittersweet. The war has changed them, and they are no longer the same people they were before they left. The brothers struggle to reintegrate into family life and the rural lifestyle of Guadalupe. Their restlessness and desire for independence become clear as they express a longing to leave home and explore new opportunities. This tension causes conflict with their parents, especially their father, Gabriel, who had high hopes for his sons to continue the family tradition of living as vaqueros (cowboys).

Antonio observes this growing divide and begins to understand the complexities of adulthood and family dynamics. He also reflects on his own future and feels caught between the different expectations of his parents: his father’s dream of freedom on the llano (plains) and his mother’s desire for him to become a priest.

--- Chapter 3
In Chapter Three, Antonio continues to grapple with the conflicting expectations placed upon him by his family and the cultural tensions between his parents’ differing backgrounds. His father, Gabriel, is a vaquero (cowboy) who yearns for the open plains, while his mother, María, is deeply religious and wishes for Antonio to become a priest. Antonio is also dealing with the presence of Ultima, the curandera (healer) who lives with them. He is both fascinated and mystified by her power and wisdom.

As Antonio spends more time with Ultima, he begins to observe her rituals and the way she interacts with nature. This chapter introduces the idea that Antonio is on a path of self-discovery, where he must navigate the expectations of his family, his culture, and his own identity. The chapter ends with Antonio feeling a growing sense of connection to Ultima, who seems to understand him in ways that others do not.
