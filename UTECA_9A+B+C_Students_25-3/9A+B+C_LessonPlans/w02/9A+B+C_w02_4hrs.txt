HW_02 [Due: 20 May 2025]

--- Task 1
With reference to the readings on communication and information theory (documents 02a, 02b, and 02c in the 1P folder) and our class discussions, answer the following questions:

	1. How does Claude Shannon view the process of communication?
	2. In Indo-European languages, a message can be defined as a sequence of words where each word has 
	frequency or probability of occurrence. Shannon discovered a way to measure the information content of 
	messages. Explain why completely reduntant messages or completely random messages contain virtually no 
	information.
	3. Based on information theory, what types of messages contain the maximum amount of information?
	4. What is Zipf's Law?
	5. Give an example of a generative model for languages.
	
--- Task 2
Read the paper, "Trajectories of the Earth System in the Anthropocene" (03_Steffen-etal_Trajectories-Earth-System-in-the-Anthropocene). By focusing on the Abstract, Introduction, and Conclusions sections of the paper, write a one+-paragraph summary of the entire paper in English.
