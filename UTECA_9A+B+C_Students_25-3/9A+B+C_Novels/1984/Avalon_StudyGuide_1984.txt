The novel depicts a dystopian world under the rule of a totalitarian regime led by Big Brother. The government exercises absolute control over every aspect of citizens' lives, including thoughts and beliefs.
    Key Examples: The Party's use of propaganda, surveillance, censorship, and manipulation of history.

2. Surveillance and Big Brother
Constant surveillance by the Party is a primary method of control. The idea that "Big Brother is watching you" creates a sense of fear and obedience.

Fear is a central mechanism of control in the novel. The Party uses fear to keep citizens in check and to maintain its authority.
