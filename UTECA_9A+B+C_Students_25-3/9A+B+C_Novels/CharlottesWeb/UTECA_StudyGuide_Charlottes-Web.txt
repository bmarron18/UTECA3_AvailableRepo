The chapter begins early in the morning with Fern discovering that her father, Mr. Arable, is planning to kill a runt pig from a litter that was just born. Fern is horrified and convinces her father to let her keep the pig, arguing that it is unfair to kill a pig just because it is small. Mr. Arable agrees, and Fern names the pig Wilbur.
