	Sen, "Development as Freedom"	<== Intro
	
	inter alia (among other things)
	
		==> free and sustainable agency as a major engine of development
		==> Freedoms are not only the primary ends of development, 
		they are also among its principal means
		==> there are mutually reinforcing connections between the freedoms of different kinds
		
		
		unfreedoms
			economic poverty (no food, water, clothing, shelter, money)
			lack of public facilities and social care (health, education, security)
			lack of political and civil liberties (restrictions on social, political and economic life)
		
What people can positively achieve is influenced by substantive freedoms
	economic opportunities, 
	political liberties, 
	social powers, 
	good health, 
	basic education, 
	encouragement and cultivation of initiatives
	liberty to participate in social choice
	liberty to participate in the making of public decisions
	
Five distinct types of freedom, seen in an "instrumental" perspective,
are particularly investigated in the empirical studies that follow.
(1) political freedoms, 
(2) economic facilities, 
(3) social opportunities, 
(4) transparency guarantees
{5) protective security.
