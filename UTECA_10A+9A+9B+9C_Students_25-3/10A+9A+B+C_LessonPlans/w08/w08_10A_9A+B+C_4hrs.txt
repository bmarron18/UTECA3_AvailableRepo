Sen big ideas
		==> free and sustainable agency as a major engine of development
		==> Freedoms are not only the primary ends of development, 
		they are also among its principal means
		==> there are mutually reinforcing connections between the freedoms of different kinds
		
Sen defines "unfreedoms"
			economic poverty (no food, water, clothing, shelter, money)
			lack of public facilities and social care (no health, education, security)
			lack of political and civil liberties (restrictions on social, political and economic life)

	(1) political freedoms
	(2) economic facilities
	(3) social opportunities
	(4) transparency guarantees
	{5) protective and transactional security
