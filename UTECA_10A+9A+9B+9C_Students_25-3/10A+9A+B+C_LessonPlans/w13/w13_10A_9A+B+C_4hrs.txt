** Marron's Rules for Consultants
-------------------------------
	1. NEVER give your client a draft. Only release your ABSOLUTE BEST WORK. 
	Remember, "God is in the details." (if you must break this rule, watermark every page of every document with the word, DRAFT and state in the transmittal that the draft was per client request)

	2. Keep records of ALL client interactions (phone calls, email, casual conversations, etc. DOCUMENT EVERYTHING!)
	
	3. Archive, Archive, Archive!
	
	4. Be real but absolutely professional AT ALL TIMES.
	
	5. Written communications must ALWAYS be at the highest level of professionalism.


Transmittals, Deliverables, Cover Letters
------------------------------------------
A transmittal is a formal action. A transmittal is the act of sending your clinet your finished product. A transmittal includes:
	i) 	a transmittal letter; and
	ii) the deliverable(s) (your finished product)


The transmittal letter:
	+ a formal cover letter that accompanies a larger document or package, introducing the document and providing context or instructions for the recipient
	+ standard business letter format, with a clear and concise tone
	+ explanations, instructions, new info (as needed)
	+ "Do not hesitate to call..." statement
	+ "thank you (appreciation)" statement (as appropriate)


The Deliverable(s):
	+ Triple-edited for typos and for accuracy
	+ Attached to transmittal letter or drive address to file(s)

Exam 3P -- Open Book
T1
	Why are LLMs called “large language models”?

T3
	--Briefly define what is meant by the Moral Accountability Gap?
	2. Moral Accountability Gap -- AI may make individual persons less able to understand, explain, and reflect upon their own and other (human) agents’ behaviour.  
	AI contributes to the creation of a more complex chain of decision-making and action (the “problem of many hands”)
	AI due to its intrinsic opacity, might make a system’s behaviour extra hard to understand and explain
	AI technology development and production is arguably pervaded by an increasing pressure towards deploying proprietary technologies that, even when working through mechanisms accessible to their developers and programmers, are designed to be inaccessible to public scrutiny


	--Briefly define what is meant by the Public Accountability Gap?
	Citizens not being able to get an explanation for decisions taken by public agencies, politicians, civil servants, and other human agents invested with a public function bc gov´t has outsourced to private companies AND/OR bc AI is opaque


	--Briefly explain the authors' integrated solution to AI responsibility known as Meaningful Human Control (MHC)
	MHC requires that two conditions be satisfied: “tracking” and “tracing”.
	Tracking: the nature of the AI human-machine relationship is well-defined (AI is aligned with human goals, values, and intentions)
	Tracing: the AI human-machine relationship requires human control and responsibility at every step (there is someone who understands the AI system and has the authority to accept responsibility from design through deployment).
