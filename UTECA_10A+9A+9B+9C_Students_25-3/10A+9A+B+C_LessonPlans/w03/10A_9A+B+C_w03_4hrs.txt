--- Task 2
Mexico's legal system is a Civil Law system, heavily influenced by Spanish and French legal traditions. Leyes and Códigos form the backbone of this system which is overseen by the Poder Judicial de la Federación. Within the judiciary, courts look to tesis documents for guidance and to jurisprudencia documents for strict interpretation in case law. Translate the following two legal documents into English:
		04a_TesisAislada_PruebaPericial.pdf
		04b_Ley-de-Poder-Judicial.pdf

** Legal Docs 1
	Quick look at Mexico's legal system/structure
	
	Common Law vs. Civil Law (fr. Cornell Law School, Legal Information Institute)

		Common law is law that is derived from judicial decisions instead of from statutes . American 
		courts originally fashioned common law rules based on English common law until the American legal 
		system was sufficiently mature to create common law rules either from direct precedent or by 
		analogy to comparable areas of decided law.
		
		Civil law, as a legal system, refers to a popular way of structuring legal systems around broad 
		codes and detailed statutes that determines the rights and obligations of individuals, without 
		emphasis on the role of precedent, courts, judges, and juries as in common law countries. 
		Civil law countries typically are characterized by their emphasis on the codified law only with 
		judges playing the main role of finding the facts and applying the law in courts. 
	
	
	Poder Judicial de la Federación

    		La Suprema Corte de Justicia de la Nación
   			El Consejo de la Judicatura Federal
   			Los Plenos Regionales

    		Los Tribunales Colegiados de Apelación
    		Los Juzgados de Distrito
    		El Tribunal Electoral del Poder Judicial de la Federación
	
	Diario Oficial de la Federacion
		El Diario Oficial de la Federación (DOF) es el órgano de publicación oficial del Gobierno 
		Constitucional de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos. Su función principal es publicar las leyes, 
		reglamentos, acuerdos, circulares, órdenes y demás actos expedidos por los poderes de la 
		Federación.

	Tesis Aisladas y Jurisprudencia
		Las tesis aisladas y la jurisprudencia son documentos que contienen criterios relevantes 
		contenidos en las sentencias. Tesis aislada es un criterio de interpretación que orienta a los 
		jueces, mientras que la jurisprudencia es la doctrina que establece la SCJN. La jurisprudencia es 
		obligatoria, mientras que la tesis aislada no lo es.
