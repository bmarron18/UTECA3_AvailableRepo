** AI 2027

** AI and Rersponsibility
A. Active Responsibility
	forward-looking; concerns the goals, values, and (legal) norms that agents (such as engineers) are 
	supposed to promote and comply with as well as the consequences they need to prevent and avoid; the legal 
	duty to provide high standards of safety; so-called corporate social responsibility of companies
	
	1, Active Responsibility Gap
		the risk that persons designing, using, and interacting with AI may not be sufficiently aware, capable, 
		and motivated to see and act according to their moral obligations towards the behaviour of the systems 
		they design, control, or use. In particular,this gap concerns the obligation to ensure that these 
		systems do not impact negatively on the rights and interests of other persons and, ideally, positively 
		contribute to their well-being instead.
	
B. Passive Responsibility
	backward-looking; concerns the moral and legal consequences agents must face in case something goes 
	wrong.
	
	1. Moral Accountability Gap
		the reduction of human agents‚Äô capacity to make sense of ‚Äì and explain to each other (ie to other 
		humans) the ‚Äúlogic‚Äù of their behaviour, due to the mediation (ie the interposition) of opaque, 
		unexplainable AI algorithms and complex autonomous systems and/or the lack of appropriate 
		psychological, social incentives or institutional spaces that promote these explanations.
		
		the difficulty for engineers and other agents involved in
the process of technological development to systematically discuss with one another
their understanding of the goal and meaning of this process.
	
	2.	Culpability Gap
		the risk that no human agent might be legitimately blamed or held culpable for the unwanted outcomes of 
		actions mediated by AI systems
	
	3. Public Accountability Gap
		citizens not being able to get an explanation for decisions taken by public agencies
