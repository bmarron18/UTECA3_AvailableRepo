--- Task 1
Mexico's legal system is a Civil Law system, heavily influenced by Spanish and French legal traditions. Leyes and Códigos form the backbone of this system which is overseen by the Poder Judicial de la Federación. Within the judiciary, courts look to tesis documents for guidance and to jurisprudencia documents for strict interpretation in case law. Translate the following two legal documents into English:

		01_Ley-de-Poder-Judicial.pdf	<== Articulo 9 (I, II, III, IV) ONLY!!
		02_TesisAislada_PruebaPericial.pdf

--- Task 2
Translate the following two axioms from standard economics into Spanish:

Axiom 1: As a society, our resources—land, labor, and capital—are insufficient to produce all the  goods and services we might desire. In other words, society faces a scarcity of resources.

Axiom 2: All production carries an opportunity cost: To produce more of one thing, society must shift resources away from producing something else. “There is no such thing as a free lunch.”
		

--- Task 3
Read Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 of "Bless Me, Ultima" and answer the following questions:
	i) Answer all of the questions from Chapter 1
	ii) Answer five (of the 13) questions from Chapter 2. Your can choose which questions to answer.

More law, less justice.
	Marcus Tullius Cicero (statesman, lawyer, scholar, philosopher, orator, writer and academic skeptic)


"The first lesson of economics is scarcity: there is never enough of anything to fully satisfy all those who want it. The first lesson of politics is to disregard the first lesson of economics."
			--- Thomas Sowell
			(economist, economic historian, social philosopher, and political commentator)

Task 2

	* a mathematical, probability-based model specifically trained for generating a logical sequence of symbols (words)
	* the Bayesian probabilities come from symbol (word) frequency distributions (Zipś Law)

Task 3
	* a point past which the Earth system's biogeophysical features will be irrevocably altered, perhaps 
	  for millenia
	* the holes or pockets represent biogeophysical states of the Earth system; events/factors can push

	  state
	* decarbonization of the global economy

Task 4
	* the research evidence suggests that an academic writing style using a third-person point of view
	  is still the rule
	* opinion

Task 5
	* Wilbur, a runt pig, is saved from an early death by kind-hearted Fern, a young farm girl.
	  Wilbur is sold to Fern's uncle, Homer Zuckerman and begins life in Zuckerman's barn cellar.
	  Wilbur is a sensitive and overly dramatic soul. He is lonely in his new home even though the barn 
	  cellar is full of other creatures and a few notable characters like Templeton the rat, the Goose, 
	  and the Old Sheep. Wilbur is informed by the Old Sheep that he is being fattened for slaughter 
	  (Christmas dinner!).
	  
	  Enter Charlotte, a clever and compassionate spider who befriends Wilbur and courageously devises
	  a plan to save him. Charlotte spins flattering words into her web ("Some Pig", "Terrific", 
	  "Radiant") that suggest Wilbur is no ordinary pig. The Zuckermans and all of the townspeople fall 
	  for the trick and Wilbur is crated up for a special appearance at the County Fair. Charlotte and 
	  Templeton go along as stowaways.
	  
	  The events at Count Fair provide the climax of the story. Wilbur loses the blue ribbon but wins a 
	  special prize which saves his life. Fern, who had been continuously by Wilbur's side, is beginning 
	  to grow up. At the County Fair she is more entranced with riding the Ferris wheel with a boy named 
	  Henry Fussy than following the exploits of Wilbur, Charlotte, and Templeton. Charlotte builds her 
	  egg sac but cannot return to the barn cellar. Templeton rescues the egg sac with the promise of 
	  perpetual food and Wilbur endearingly takes the egg sac back home. Charlotte dies alone.
	  
	  Next spring the young spiders hatch. Wilbur is delighted but soon becomes desperately sad as all 
	  the young spiders seem to have floated away. Fortunately, three spiders remain and take up 
	  residence in their mother's doorway. Wilbur lives out the rest of his days in the wonderful barn 
	  cellar surrounded by generations of spiders, geese, and other friends.

	Quick look at Mexico's legal system/structure
	
Civil Law (Mexico) vs Common Law (US)
	Cornell Law SchoolChapter 1, Chapter 2, Legal Information Institute
	https://www.law.cornell.edu/
	https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/legal_systems

		Common law is law that is derived from judicial decisions instead of from statutes . American 
		courts originally fashioned common law rules based on English common law until the American legal 
		system was sufficiently mature to create common law rules either from direct precedent or by 
		analogy to comparable areas of decided law.
		
		Civil law, as a legal system, refers to a 
		popular way of structuring legal systems around broad codes and detailed statutes that determines 
		the rights and obligations of individuals, without emphasis on the role of precedent, courts, 
		judges, and juries as in common law countries. Civil law countries typically are characterized by 
		their emphasis on the codified law only with judges playing the main role of finding the facts 
		and applying the law in courts.

** Economics Docs I
	A quick look at standard economic axioms, theorems, and corollaries
	
Economics: The study of choice and resource allocation under conditions of scarcity.

Axiom 1: As a society, our resources—land, labor, and capital—are insufficient to produce all the  goods and services we might desire. In other words, society faces a scarcity of resources.

	Theorem 1: Only in rare circumstance can we (individually) produce all of the goods and services  we 
	need. We are economically linked to others in hundreds—even thousands—of different ways.
	
	Theorem 2: All (functional) economies exhibit high degrees of specialization and exchange because 
	specialization and exchange enable us to enjoy greater production, and higher living standards than 
	would otherwise be possible.


Axiom 2: All production carries an opportunity cost: To produce more of one thing, society must shift resources away from producing something else. “There is no such thing as a free lunch.”
		
	Theorem 1. In a market system, individuals are not simply free to do what they want. Rather, they are 
	constrained by the resources tChapter 1, Chapter 2hey control.
	
		Corollary 1: We do not all start in the same place in the economic race. Individuals may have 
		more or less resources under their control than others.
