** Bless Me, Ultima
	Myth as the Cognitive Process of Popular Culture in Rudolfo Anaya's Bless Me, Ultima:
	The Dialectics of Knowledge by Enrique Lamadrid

The Dialectics of Knowledge
	In essence, the dialectics of knowledge provides a framework for understanding knowledge as a complex, 
	evolving entity, shaped by internal contradictions and external interactions, rather than a fixed and 
	unchanging body of information.
	
	a perspective that views knowledge as a dynamic, evolving entity shaped by internal contradictions and 
	interactions with its opposite. It emphasizes the interplay of opposing forces, such as individual and 
	social knowledge, or new and obsolete knowledge, to understand how knowledge develops and changes over 
	time. This approach, often rooted in dialectical materialism, sees knowledge as a social and material 
	process, not a static collection of facts


Mythical realism (cf. magical realism)
	myth, the collective interpretation of the contradictions in the historical and ecological experience of a 
	people.
	
Problem Statement and Thesis
	Anaya penetrates deeply the mythical conscience of the reader through the relationship of Ultima 
	(sorceress) and Antonio (apprentice). How does he do it?
	
	something exceptional about the emerging consciousness of the boy...mystically harmonious with nature 
	but a dynamic, even dialectical awareness of historical forces....invite a reexamination of the relation of 
	myth and social consciousness, often considered antithetical incompatible categories that undermine and 
	erode each other....the novel apparently transcends this impasse
	
	Despite their enthusiasm for his novel, critics have thus far been unable to define the parameters of this 
	response nor prove the reason for its depth
	
	What is proposed here is a more dynamic critical approachto myth which goes beyond scholasticism and the 
	tracing of classical mythologies. Myth is here considered to be an ongoing process of interpreting and 
	mediating the contradictions in the everyday historical experience of the people. At the novel's heart is
	the process which generates social and historical consciousness.
	
	
Ultima and Antonio as the Constructs of the Thesis
	the ultimate focus is not that Ultima is the repository of an ancient system of knowledge nor the usual 
	supernatural feats of a curandera.....it is her role as a cultural mediator and Antonio's natural 
	inclination towards a similar calling that link them to their real power...the ability to recognize and 
	resolve the internal contradictions of their culture
	
	People turn to Ultima and Antonio at crucial moments in their lives because they are instinctively aware 
	that mediators (curanderas and trickters) possess an overview or power of synthesis that can help them 
	resolve their problems.
	
	The power invested in the mythical process is the knowledge derived from seeing the world as a totality and 
	understanding its contradictions in a dialectical manner.
