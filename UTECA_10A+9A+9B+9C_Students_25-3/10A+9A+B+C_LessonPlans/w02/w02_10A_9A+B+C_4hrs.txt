--- Task 1
With reference to the readings on communication and information theory (documents 02a, 02b, and 02c in the 1P folder) and our class discussions, please answer the following questions:

	1. How does Claude Shannon view the process of communication?
	2. In Indo-European languages, a message can be defined as a sequence of words where each word has a 
	frequency or probability of occurrence. Shannon discovered a way to measure the information content 
	of a string of words (message). Explain why completely redundtant messages or completely random 
	messages contain virtually no information.
	3. Based on information theory, what types of messages contain the maximum amount of information?
	4. What is Zipf's Law?
	5. Give an example of a generative model for languages.
	
--- Task 2
Read the paper, "Trajectories of the Earth System in the Anthropocene" (03_Steffen-etal_Trajectories-Earth-System-in-the-Anthropocene). By focusing on the Abstract, Introduction, and Conclusions sections of the paper, write a one+-paragraph summary of the entire paper in English.


--- Task 3
Provide English definitions and a Spanish word translation for all of the words in the document, Vocab_01.txt: a list of 72 words from Readings 01, 02, 03.


--- Task 4
Read Chapters I through XI of "Charlotte's Web." Be prepared to contribute next week to a Socratic-style seminar that focuses on these chapters. In the seminar we will

	i) 		analyze highlights and important events as plot elements, 
	ii) 	analyze characters and their motivations 
			[Character maps that include their traits, relationships, and key events]
	iii) 	evaluate the stylistic elements used by the author (genre), and 
	iv) 	critique the author's choices and style
(to) glisten
NB. Ultimately, you will write a full critique of this novel.

“Overall, then, we will view CAS [complex ada(to) glistenptive systems] as systems composed of interacting agents described in terms of rules. These agents adapt by changing their rules as experience accumulates. In CAS, a major part of the environment of any given adaptive agent consists of other adaptive agents, so that a portion of any agent's efforts at adaptation is spent adapting to other adaptive agents. This one feature is a major source of the complex temporal patterns that CAS generate. To understand CAS we must understand these ever-changing patterns.”
		― John H. Holland, Hidden Order: How Adaptation Builds Complexity 
		(pioneer in genetic algorithms)




“In a systemic world, there is no such thing as a discrete or isolated event - impacts cascade and spill over.”
		― Roger Spitz, The Definitive Guide to Thriving on Disruption (futurist, 
		techistentialist)

		My Take-a-way ----
		Phonemes ==> smallest unit of linguistic analysis, which are usually combined into 
		words.
		Articulation ==> can change the meaning of a word
		Morphological forms ==> a significant role in constructing meaning (e.g., 
		prefixes, suffixes)
		Polysemy ==> when the same word has several meanings
		Grammar and syntax 	==> the set of rules that guide language users about ways 
								to construct meaning, language specific
							“Let’s eat, grandma!
		Discourse analysis ==> how text flows
			Coherence
			Conversation Turn Taking
			Narrative
			Development of Genre
		Pragmatics ==> use of language to achieve goals
		Socio-linguistics 	==> social groups develop their own language! (jargon)
			NB. Japanese, Chinese, or Korean, have a unique characteristic: they can be 
			written horizontally or vertically, 
			and the direction of writing can influence the meaning of what is written.
