** Standard Economic Axioms, Theorems, and Corollaries
	Economics: The study of choice and resource allocation under conditions of scarcity.

Axiom 1: As a society, our resources—land, labor, and capital—are insufficient to produce all the  goods and services we might desire. In other words, society faces a scarcity of resources.

	Theorem 1: Only in rare circumstance can we (individually) produce all of the goods and services  we need. We are 
	economically linked to others in hundreds—even thousands—of different ways.
	
	Theorem 2: All (functional) economies exhibit high degrees of specialization and exchange because specialization and 
	exchange enable us to enjoy greater production, and higher living standards than would otherwise be possible.


Axiom 2: All production carries an opportunity cost: To produce more of one thing, society must  shift resources away from producing something else. “There is no such thing as a free lunch.”
		
	Theorem 1. In a market system, individuals are not simply free to do what they want. Rather, they are constrained by the 
	resources they control.
	
		Corrollary 1: We do not all start in the same place in the economic race. Individuals may have more or less resources 
		under their control than others.
