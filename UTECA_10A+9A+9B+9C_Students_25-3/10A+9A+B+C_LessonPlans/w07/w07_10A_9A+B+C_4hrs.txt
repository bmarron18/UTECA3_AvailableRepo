--- Task 1
In the "real world", large organizations (both public and private) get work done by hiring 
contractors through an RFP (Request for Proposal) process. Perform the following:
	1. Define the term, RFP and provide a very briefly explain how the RFP process is used for hiring 
	contractors.
	2. Look at the "Pliego de Requisitos" from the RFP, CFE-0104-CACON-0030-2025 (34 pp.) Translate the 
	first seven (7) paragraphs from page one (1) of this document into English. These paragraphs are very 
	short; in one case just a single line.

--- Task 2
Read the excerpt (Preface and Introduction) from Amartya Sen's, "Freedom as Development" and answer the following questions,
	1. Sen notes that "unfreedoms" rob individuals of agency and therefore contribute to miseries of one kind or another. List three (3) broad categories of unfreedoms.
	2. Sen argues that development must have a broader definition than simply economic enhancement. What is Sen's definition of development?
	3. According to Sen, what are the five (5) distinct types of freedoms and why are they synergistic? 
	4. Does Sen commend or chastise the role of markets?


--- Task 3
Read Chapter 3 and Chapter 4 of "Bless Me, Ultima." Select and answer five (5) questions from the list of questions for Chapter 3 and five (5) questions from the list of questions for Chapter 4. See the document, "UTECA_StudyGuide_Bless-Me-Ultima.txt" for the list of questions for each chapter. Be sure to format your answers correctly (see Marron_StyleGuide_25-3.pdf).

Work in the Real World: Intro to RFPs

RFP (Request for Proposal)
		a formal document used to solicit detailed proposals from potential vendors for complex goods or 
		services, allowing them to showcase their expertise and approach alongside pricing. RFPs are 
		used when the buyer needs a more detailed proposal outlining how a vendor would approach 
		fulfilling their needs. An RFP typically outlines the project scope, requirements, evaluation 
		criteria, and timeline for proposals. Vendors respond with a proposal.

Recall--
*Axiom 2: All production carries an opportunity cost: To produce more of one thing, society must shift resources away from producing something else. “There is no such thing as a free lunch.”
	**Theorem 1. In a market system, individuals are not simply free to do what they want. Rather, they 
	are constrained by the resources they control.
		***Corollary 1: We do not all start in the same place in the economic race. Individuals may have 
		more or less resources under their control than others.


What is freedom?
What is opportunity?
What is development?
What is welfare?
What is agency?
What is the role of government?

Silent Reading
	Preface
	inter alia (among other things)



Sen big ideas
		==> free and sustainable agency as a major engine of development
		==> Freedoms are not only the primary ends of development, 
		they are also among its principal means
		==> there are mutually reinforcing connections between the freedoms of different kinds
		
		
Sen defines "unfreedoms"
			economic poverty (no food, water, clothing, shelter, money)
			lack of public facilities and social care (no health, education, security)
			lack of political and civil liberties (restrictions on social, political and economic life)
		
Sen states that what people can positively achieve is influenced by substantive freedoms.
Substantive freedoms are:
	economic opportunities
	political liberties
	social powers
	good health
	basic education
	encouragement and cultivation of initiatives
	liberty to participate in social choice
	liberty to participate in the making of public decisions
	
Five distinct types of freedom, seen in an "instrumental" perspective:
	(1) political freedoms
	(2) economic facilities
	(3) social opportunities
	(4) transparency guarantees
	{5) protective security
