Work in the Real World: Intro to RFPs

RFPs (Request for Proposals)
		a formal document used to solicit detailed proposals from potential vendors for complex goods or 
		services, allowing them to showcase their expertise and approach alongside pricing. RFPs are 
		used when the buyer needs a more detailed proposal outlining how a vendor would approach 
		fulfilling their needs. An RFP typically outlines the project scope, requirements, evaluation 
		criteria, and timeline for proposals

Examples

	UNHCR_RFP-MEX-2020-206
	Artifact_DEQ_RFQforPlatformSecurityTesting_Final_ 20200331

Recall--
Axiom 2: All production carries an opportunity cost: To produce more of one thing, society must shift resources away from producing something else. “There is no such thing as a free lunch.”
		
	Theorem 1. In a market system, individuals are not simply free to do what they want. Rather, they 
	are constrained by the resources they control.
	
		Corrollary 1: We do not all start in the same place in the economic race. Individuals may have 
		more or less resources under their control than others.


What is opportunity?
What is freedom?
What is development?
What is welfare?
What is agency?
What is the role of government?
