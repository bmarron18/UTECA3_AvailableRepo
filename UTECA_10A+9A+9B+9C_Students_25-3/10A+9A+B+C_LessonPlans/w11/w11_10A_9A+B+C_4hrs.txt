	We're making this analogy that AI is the new electricity. Electricity transformed industries: agriculture, 
	transportation, communication, manufacturing.
				--- Andrew Ng 
			
			
	I think that, hundreds of years from now, if people invent a technology that we haven't heard of yet, maybe 
	a computer could turn evil. But the future is so uncertain. I don't know what's going to happen five years 
	from now. The reason I say that I don't worry about AI turning evil is the same reason I don't worry about 
	overpopulation on Mars.
