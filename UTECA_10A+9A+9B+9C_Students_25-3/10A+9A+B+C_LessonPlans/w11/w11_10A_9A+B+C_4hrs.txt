	We're making this analogy that AI is the new electricity. Electricity transformed industries: agriculture, 
	transportation, communication, manufacturing.
				--- Andrew Ng 
			
			
	I think that, hundreds of years from now, if people invent a technology that we haven't heard of yet, maybe 
	a computer could turn evil. But the future is so uncertain. I don't know what's going to happen five years 
	from now. The reason I say that I don't worry about AI turning evil is the same reason I don't worry about 
	overpopulation on Mars.

"unfreedoms"
		economic poverty (no food, water, clothing, shelter, money)
		lack of public facilities and social care (no health, education, security)
		lack of political and civil liberties (restrictions on social, political and economic life)
		
Substantive freedoms are:
	economic opportunities
	political liberties
	social powers
	good health
	basic education
	encouragement and cultivation of initiatives
	liberty to participate in social choice
	liberty to participate in the making of public decisions
	
Five distinct types of freedom, seen in an "instrumental" perspective:
	(1) political freedoms
	(2) economic facilities
	(3) social opportunities
	(4) transparency guarantees
	{5) protective security
