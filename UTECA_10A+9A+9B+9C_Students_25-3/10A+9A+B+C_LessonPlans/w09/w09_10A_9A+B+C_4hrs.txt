	The legal systems in Mexico and US
    The use of tesis aislada and jurisprudencia
	
	
	https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/legal_systems
		Common law is law that is derived from judicial decisions instead of from statutes . American 
		courts originally fashioned common law rules based on English common law until the American legal 
		system was sufficiently mature to create common law rules either from direct precedent or by 
		analogy to comparable areas of decided law.
		
		Civil law, as a legal system, refers to a 
		popular way of structuring legal systems around broad codes and detailed statutes that determines 
		the rights and obligations of individuals, without emphasis on the role of precedent, courts, 
		judges, and juries as in common law countries. Civil law countries typically are characterized by 
		their emphasis on the codified law only with judges playing the main role of finding the facts 
		and applying the law in courts.

		Tesis Aisladas y Jurisprudencia
		Las tesis aisladas y jurisprudencia son documentos que contienen criterios 
		relevantes contenidos en las sentencias. Tesis aislada es un criterio de interpretaci√≥n que 
		orienta a los jueces, mientras que la jurisprudencia es la doctrina que establece la SCJN. La 
		jurisprudencia es obligatoria, mientras que la tesis aislada no lo es.

	The axioms and corollaries of standard economics
	
Economics: The study of choice and resource allocation under conditions of scarcity.

Axiom 1: As a society, our resources‚Äîland, labor, and capital‚Äîare insufficient to produce all the  goods and services we might desire. In other words, society faces a scarcity of resources.

	Theorem 1: Only in rare circumstance can we (individually) produce all of the goods and services  we 
	need. We are economically linked to others in hundreds‚Äîeven thousands‚Äîof different ways.
	
	Theorem 2: All (functional) economies exhibit high degrees of specialization and exchange because 
	specialization and exchange enable us to enjoy greater production, and higher living standards than 
	would otherwise be possible.


Axiom 2: All production carries an opportunity cost: To produce more of one thing, society must shift resources away from producing something else. ‚ÄúThere is no such thing as a free lunch.‚Äù
		
	Theorem 1. In a market system, individuals are not simply free to do what they want. Rather, they are 
	constrained by the resources tChapter 1, Chapter 2hey control.
	
		Corollary 1: We do not all start in the same place in the economic race. Individuals may have 
		more or less resources under their control than others.

	Amartya Sen's thoughts on freedoms, unfreedoms, and development
	
	
	What is freedom?
	What is opportunity?
	What is development?
	What is welfare?
	What is agency?
	What is the role of government?
	
	
	Sen big ideas
		==> free and sustainable agency as a major engine of development
		==> Freedoms are not only the primary ends of development, 
		they are also among its principal means
		==> there are mutually reinforcing connections between the freedoms of different kinds
		
		
Sen defines "unfreedoms"
			economic poverty (no food, water, clothing, shelter, money)
			lack of public facilities and social care (no health, education, security)
			lack of political and civil liberties (restrictions on social, political and economic life)
		
Sen states that what people can positively achieve is influenced by substantive freedoms.
Substantive freedoms are:
	economic opportunities
	political liberties
	social powers
	good health
	basic education
	encouragement and cultivation of initiatives
	liberty to participate in social choice
	liberty to participate in the making of public decisions
	
Five distinct types of freedom, seen in an "instrumental" perspective:
	(1) political freedoms
	(2) economic facilities
	(3) social opportunities
	(4) transparency guarantees
	{5) protective security

	
5
	Responding to RFPs
	Translation of technical language related to SOPs (English ==> Spanish)
	
	RFP (Request for Proposal)
		a formal document used to solicit detailed proposals from potential vendors for complex goods or 
		services, allowing them to showcase their expertise and approach alongside pricing. RFPs are 
		used when the buyer needs a more detailed proposal outlining how a vendor would approach 
		fulfilling their needs. An RFP typically outlines the project scope, requirements, evaluation 
		criteria, and timeline for proposals. Vendors respond with a proposal.
	
	
	SOP (Standard Operating Proposal)
		A Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) is a set of written instructions that document a
		routine or repetitive activity followed by an organization. The development and use of SOPs are
		an integral part of a successful quality system as it provides individuals with the information
		to perform a job properly, and facilitates consistency in the quality and integrity of a product
		or end-result. The term ‚ÄúSOP‚Äù may not always be appropriate and terms such as protocols,
		instructions, worksheets, and laboratory operating procedures may also be used. For this
		document ‚ÄúSOP‚Äù will be used

	Herman Daly's, The Perils of Free Trade
	Six (6) questions

NOTES on Daly---
*free trade == deregulated international commerce

*The main problem is not the logic of Ricardo's argument for comparative advantage. It is the relevance of Ricardo's critical but often forgotten assumption that factors of production (especially capital) are internationally immobile.
(Figure p 52)

*The free traders seek to maximize profits and production without regard for considerations that represent hidden social and environmental costs. They argue that when growth has made people wealthy enough, they will have the funds to clean up the damage done by growth.

*our disciplinary preference for logically beautiful results over factually grounded policies has reached such fanatical proportions that we economists have become dangerous to the earth and its inhabitants.

*For trade to be mutually beneficial, the gains must not be o√ùset by higher liabilities:
*Liabilities / Inefficiencies / Reduced Welfare 
	-After specialization, nations are no longer free not to trade
	-the cost of transporting with subsidized petroleum
	-simultaneous import and export of essentially the same goods.
	-reduction in the range of occupational choices.
	
*Free trade ALSO runs afoul of the three basic goals of all economic policies: 
i.The efficient allocation of resources
	-efficient allocation of resources depends on full cost acounting (internalization of ALL costs)
	-competition can reduce costs in two ways: by increasing e√õciency or by lowering standards.
	-free international trade encourages industries to shift their production activities to the countries 
	that have the lowest standards of cost internalization -- hardly a move toward global efficiency


ii.The fair distribution of resources
	-If firms are free to relocate their capital internationally to wherever their production costs would 
	be lowest, then the favored countries have not merely a comparative advantage but an absolute 
	advantage (negates Ricardo)
	- w/ external capital flow domestic employment diminishes, which drives down the price for domestic 
	labor
	- nor do labor in low-wage countries do not necessarily gain from free trade (US corn in Mexico!)
	
iii. The maintenance of a sustainable scale of resource use.
	- the goal of a sustainable scale of total resource use forces us to ask : What will happen if the 
	entire population of the earth consumes resources at the rate of high-wage countries? 
	- The regenerative and assimilative capacities of the biosphere cannot support even the current 
	levels of resource consumption, much less the manyfold increase required to generalize the higher 	
	standards ("Growth fixes everything!")
	
*Multinational corps are the beneficiaries of free trade
	- The broader the free trade area, the less answerable a large and footloose corporation will be to 
	any local or even national community. Spatial separation of the places that suffer the costs and 
	enjoy the benefits becomes more feasible.

* The limiting factor on future economic growth has changed. If man-made and natural capital were good substitutes for one another, then natural capital could be totally replaced. The two are complementary, however, which means that the short supply of one imposes limits. What good are fishing boats without populations of fish?

* In the steady-state view, the economy is only one component of a larger ecosystem in which materials are transformed and energy is converted to heat. As the economy grows larger, its behavior must conform more closely to that of the total (Earth) ecosystem. What will happen if the entire population of the earth consumes resources at the rate of high-wage countries?
(Figure p 54)

* Unlimited economic growth is impossible ergo development must be redefined. Also full cost accounting must be required for all nations and corporations.
