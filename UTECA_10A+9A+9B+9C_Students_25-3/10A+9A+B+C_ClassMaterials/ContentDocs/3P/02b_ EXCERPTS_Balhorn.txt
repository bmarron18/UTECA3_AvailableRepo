In conclusion, our assessment shows that ChatGPT answers scientific questions from various domains in
advanced academic English and that its answers are between partly and mostly correct. However, these capa-
bilities come with limitations. Most importantly, we perceive a lack of critical reflection in the answers from
ChatGPT. In addition, the output from ChatGPT must be taken cautiously to avoid ethical pitfalls and potential
negative consequences in real-world applications.
