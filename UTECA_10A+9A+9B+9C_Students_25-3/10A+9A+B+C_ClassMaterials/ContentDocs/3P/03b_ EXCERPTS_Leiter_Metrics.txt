This concept paper aims at providing a systematic overview of the existing efforts in
explainable MT evaluation metrics and an outlook for promising future research directions.
The main focus of this work lies on explainable evaluation metrics for MT, although many
of our observations and discussions can likely be adapted to other NLG tasks.
We make the following contributions, outlined by the structure of our paper:

	§2 Background & Terminology: We give an overview of concepts important for
explainable MT evaluation. We also highlight different goals and the audiences that require
them.
	§4 Taxonomy: We provide a structured overview of previous efforts in explainable
MT evaluation. An overview is shown in Figure 3. The process of selecting works for this
taxonomy is described in §3 Literature Review & Selection.
	§5 Future Work: An analysis of underexplored research directions, and a collection
of exemplary methods from other NLP domains to illustrate potential future paths. Here,
we also discuss the usage of recent large language models (LLMs), like ChatGPT (OpenAI,
2023a) and GPT4 (OpenAI, 2023b).
We provide an overview of Related Work in §6 and a Conclusion in §7.
